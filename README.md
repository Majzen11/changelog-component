# Changelog Component
Roadmap.sh Changelog Component project

Project-URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/changelog-component

## URL for final project:
https://majzen11.github.io/changelog-component/

## Key requirements for this project:

In this project you are required to create a simple component for a website that displays a changelog. A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project or software. It is often used to keep users informed about the latest updates and improvements.

The goal of this project is to teach you about positioning and layout in CSS. You will create a simple HTML structure and use CSS to style it into a visually appealing and responsive changelog component. Given below is a rough mockup of the changelog component you need to create.

Feel free to customize the design and layout of the component as you see fit. The focus should be on creating a well-structured and responsive component that can be easily integrated into a website.

## My thoughts on this project
The most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to make the vertical line and dots between the dates and descriptions. I learned about the ::before and ::after pseudo elements. I haven't used that before. Don't know if I did it in the best way, but it looks okay. I looked more into css positioning after this to learn more. 
This is supposed to be "a well-structured and responsive component that can be easily integrated into a website" and I don't know if that is what it ended up being, but I'm happy with the result considering my limited knowledge so far. I'm sure I will learn better ways to do things later on.
